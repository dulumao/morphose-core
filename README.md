Morphose
==================
Fully Decentralized Protocol for Private Transactions on Binance Smart Chain

## What is Morphose
Morphose breaks the on-chain link between source and destination addresses to enable transactional privacy in Binance Smart Chain. Her smart contracts use non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, also known as zk-SNARK that require no interaction between the prover and verifier. Once a BNB deposit is withdrawn by the new address, there is absolutely no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.

## How does Morphose Work?
- Deposit: A user connects to Morphose app with his wallet and deposits BNB tokens to Morphose smart contract to get a random key (Note) in return.
- Wait: Even though it's not necessary, it is better to wait some amount of time for other people to deposit to improve privacy.
- Withdraw: User connects to Morphose app with a new wallet, submits the Note and the contract transfers the funds to desired address by getting 1% commission.
